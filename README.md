### What I learned

While working on this project, I picked up some cool CSS tricks that made my code more powerful and maintainable:

#### 1. CSS Data Attributes are Awesome!
Discovered how to use ```data-*``` attributes to store extra information in HTML that CSS can access. This is perfect for creating dynamic styles without extra classes.
#### 2. CSS Variables
Learned how to use ```--custom-variables``` to create reusable values that can be changed globally.
#### 3. Grid & Flex Best Friends
Got more comfortable using CSS Grid and Flexbox for alignment.
#### 4. Data Attributes + Variables = Magic
I discovered how to combine Data Attributes with CSS Variables to create dynamic styles that respond to HTML changes.
